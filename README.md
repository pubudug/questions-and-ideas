Some of the questions might not apply in some cases (for example, not all comapanies have dedicated QAs, small companies might not have multiple teams, some companies might not have mutlple products etc.)

* What products do you have?
* Do you have several teams working on the products?
* How are the products split between the teams?
* Do you have QAs?
* If you do have QAs are they part of the teams or are they a seperate team?
* How big are the teams?
* What is the composition of the team and what are the roles of the team members?
* How are estimates made and how are tasks assigned?
* What other (supporting) teams are there? (sysadmins etc.)
* How is the company organized (including non-technical teams)
* What communication channels are used to communicate within the team and to communicate outside the team(chat channels etc.)?
* Do you work in iterations? How long is an iteration?
* How often do you do releases and do you have different kinds of releases (dev, qa,staging prod etc.?)
* Does the whole team know about the tragets and what other team members are working on?
* Do you do code reviews? Do all the members have a change to review the code (that is, is the code review request sent to all members of the team or only to maybe a team lead?)
* Is the whole team aware of the deicision been made(about the products that they are responsible for)?
* Before implementing a feature, do you come up with a design?
* Does the team make decisions or does the team take decisions from somewhere else?
* Would you say there is technical debt in the software? If yes, is something being done to fix those?
* How did the techinical debt come to exist in the first place? Has there been any discussion on that? 
* Do you have something similar to a retrospecitve where you would look at what you did in the last iteration and discuss how things could be done better?
* If there is a difference of ideas between the team members how is it usually solved?
* Is there a requirements owner(s)? (a role like Product Owner in Scurm?)? If yes, does the team have constant contact/discussions with them? Are they part of the team?
* How do you make sure that a new starter can start contributing quickly? If you already have such a process, did you review it with the people who already went through it and discussed how it could have been made better? When does this training happen? If they happen infrequently, are there recordings of the trainings so that one can go through them and become informed?
* Is there some form of documentaiton available to understand the product(domain), the architecture and design of the software? Does the documentation contain the reasons why a certain technoligy,design or architectre was selected?
* Can you give a high-level explanation about the architecture and how modules are sepereated?
* What kind of automated tests do you have? (unit/integration tests?) and would you say that each of the modules are well tested? If some modules do not have tests yet, are there plans on implementing automated test for those?
* What technolgies, 
    * frameworks, 
    * programming languages, 
    * important libraries 
do you use in each layer?
* Are all the products being actively developed? If there are products that are not actively developed, what techlogigies are used in those products?
* What tools do you use ( for example, 
    * Operating System, 
    * version control, 
    * IDE, 
    * build tools, 
    * CI, 
    * deployement tools., 
    * Issue tracking)
* What is the usual workflow of fixing a bug (from being reported to going into production)?
* What is the usual workflow of implementing a feature (from being requested to going into production)?
* Is there On-call duties?
* Is there some live monitoring of the application to help the people who are on call?
* Do you give the possiblility to work from home?
* What are the expectations from me during the first three, six, twelve months? 
* How often will there be reviews?
* Are there any additional benefits (professional training budget, gym membership etc.)
* Will I have to work overtime? Will I have to travel?
* Who are your competitors? What plans does the company have for the near future?
* Any dress code that developers must adhere to?
