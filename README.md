Some of the questions might not apply in some cases (for example, not all comapanies have dedicated QAs, small companies might not have multiple teams, some companies might not have mutlple products etc.)

* What products do you have?
* Do you have several teams working on the products?
* How are the products split between the teams?
* Do you have QAs?
* If you do have QAs are they part of the teams or are they a seperate team?
* Do you work in iterations? How long is an iteration?
* Does the whole team know about the tragets and what other team members are working on?
* Do you do code reviews? Do all the members have a change to review the code (that is, is the code review request sent to all members of the team or only to maybe a team lead?)
* Is the whole team aware of the deicision been made(about the products that they are responsible for)?
* Before implementing a feature, do you come up with a design?
* Does the team make decisions or does the team take decisions from somewhere else?
* Would you say there is technical debt in the software? If yes, is something being done to fix those?
* How did the techinical debt come to exist in the first place? Has there been any discussion on that? 
* Do you have something similar to a retrospecitve where you would look at what you did in the last iteration and discuss how things could be done better?
* If there is a difference of ideas between the team members how is it usually solved?
* Is there a requirements owner? (a role like Product Owner in Scurm?)? If yes, does the team have constant contact/discussions with them? Are they part of the team?
* How do you make sure that a new starter can start contributing quickly? If you already have such a process, did you review it with the people who already went through it and discussed how it could have been made better?
* Is there some form of documentaiton available to understand the product(domain), the architecture and design of the software?
* Can you give a high-level explanation about the architecture and how modules are sepereated?
* What technolgies/frameworks do you use in each layer?
* Is there some live monitoring of the application?
* What tools do you use ( for example, Operating System, version control, IDE, build tools, CI, deployement etc., Issue tracking)
* What is the usual workflow of fixing a bug (from being reported to going into production)?
* What is the usual workflow of implementing a feature (from being requested to going into production)?
* How often will there be reviews?
* Are there any additional benefits (professional training budget, gym membership etc.)
